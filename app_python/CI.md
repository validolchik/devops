# CI best practices
* Try to minimize Actions, only necessary actions included
* Don't install dependencies unnecessarily
* Use Secrets from github to store the secrets, do not hardcode them
* Limit environment variables to the narrowest possible scope.
Docker username and password needed only in build job, so created env variables in this job
* Provide authors and description of an Action
* Donâ€™t use self-hosted runners in a public repository

## Best practices for using Docker in Github Actions
* Use Docker Hub access token, instead of password
* Use `registry` type cache to not build built stages and decrease build time
